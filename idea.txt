A sort of diary where you write stuff that happened to you, that you want to discuss, or really anything you want,
you can make a promise to yourself etc, you can add pictures, videos, voice notes (limit total size?), your mood,
a color that you associate with it, etc.

Then those memories are locked for a certain amount of time (1 year for example, can be changed).
When those memories unlock, you receive them by email, to remind you.

Do not omit css, the interface should be calm and cozy, light blue color palette, slight roundings,
should not force you on the eye, I'll see dark mode at last.

Use Gmail for email OR Zeptomail if I make it work, with the @diarytrove.woah.pw domain.

Can change the reveal delay or date on each entry.
At account creation, ask if the user wants the possibility to change the reveal delay on the fly.
If the answer is no, then the user won't be able to change the reveal date at all,
and won't be able to use custom delays on entries.
If the user changes the default delay, all entries with default delay will become revealed if they should have been then,
but without sending email.

Setting to only send emails for entries with certain moods (to avoid receiving emails from bad moments).
