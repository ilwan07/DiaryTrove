# DiaryTrove
_"Because your memories are your most precious data"_

DiaryTrove is a sort of mix between a personal diary and a time capsule. You can write notes whenever you feel like so. In addition to writing, you can also select your mood using an emoji selector, and even upload media files such as images, videos or even audio recordings!

Once you're done writing, your memory will get saved to the database, and will be locked for a certain amount of time, for example a year. While the memory is locked, it won't appear on your gallery page.
But once the lock time ends, the memory will appear on your page, and you will also receive it by email!

If you wish to host and deploy the web app yourself (for better privacy, performance, or higher upload limits for example), then check out DEPLOYMENT.md
